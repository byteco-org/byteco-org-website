  "page-open-staking-image-alt": "Image of the Rhino mascot for the open launchpad.",
  "page-open-staking-51-desc-1": "Staking makes joining the network as a validator more accessible so it’s likely that there’ll be more validators in the network than exists today. This will make this kind of attack even harder as the cost of an attack will increase.",
  "page-open-staking-accessibility": "More accessible",
  "page-open-staking-accessibility-desc": "With easier hardware requirements and the opportunity to pool if you don’t have 100 BTO, more people will be able to join the network. This will make Byteco more decentralized and secure by decreasing the attack surface area.",
  "page-open-staking-at-stake": "Your BTO is at stake",
  "page-open-staking-at-stake-desc": "Because you have to stake your BTO in order to validate transactions and create new blocks, you can lose it if you decide to try and cheat the system.",

  "page-open-staking-deposit-address-desc": "If you’ve already followed the setup instructions on the launchpad, you’ll know you need to send a transaction to the staking deposit contract. We recommend you check the address very carefully. You can find the official address on Byteco.org and a number of other trusted sites.",
  "page-open-staking-desc-1": "Rewards are given for actions that help the network reach consensus. You'll get rewards for batching transactions into a new block or checking the work of other validators because that's what keeps the chain running securely.",
  "page-open-staking-desc-2": "Although you can earn rewards for doing work that benefits the network, you can lose BTO for malicious actions, going offline, and failing to validate.",
  "page-open-staking-desc-3": "You'll need 100 BTO to become a full validator or some BTO to join a staking pool. You'll also need to run an 'Eth1' or mainnet client. The launchpad will walk you through the process and hardware requirements. Alternatively, you can use a backend API.",
  "page-open-staking-description": "Staking is the act of depositing 100 BTO to activate validator software. As a validator you’ll be responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This will keep Byteco secure for everyone and earn you new BTO in the process. This process, known as proof-of-stake, is being introduced by the Beacon Chain.",

  "page-open-staking-pool-desc": "If you have less than 100 BTO, you will be able to add a smaller stake to staking pools. Some companies can do it all on your behalf so you won't have to worry about staying online. Here are some companies to check out.",
  "page-open-staking-pos-explained": "Proof-of-stake explained",
  "page-open-staking-pos-explained-desc": "Staking is what you need to do to become a validator in a proof-of-stake system. This is a consensus mechanism that is going to replace the proof-of-work system currently in place. Consensus mechanisms are what keep blockchains like Byteco secure and decentralized.",

  "page-open-staking-sharding": "Unlocks sharding",
  "page-open-staking-sharding-desc": "Sharding is only possible with a proof-of-stake system. Sharding a proof-of-work system would dilute the amount of computing power needed to corrupt the network, making it easier for malicious miners to control shards. This isn’t the case with randomly-assigned stakers in proof of stake.",
  "page-open-staking-solo": "Stake solo and run a validator",
  "page-open-staking-solo-desc": "To begin the staking process, you’ll need to use the Bto1 launchpad. This will walk you through all the setup. Part of staking is running an Open client, which is a local copy of the blockchain. This can take a while to download onto your computer.",
  "page-open-staking-start": "Start staking",
  "page-open-staking-subtitle": "Staking is a public good for the Byteco ecosystem. You can help secure the network and earn rewards in the process.",
  "page-open-staking-sustainability": "More sustainable",
  "page-open-staking-sustainability-desc": "Validators don’t need energy-intensive computers in order to participate in a proof-of-stake system – just a laptop or smart phone. This will make Byteco better for the environment.",

  "page-open-staking-upgrades-li-3": "During this time, stakers will be adding new blocks to the Beacon Chain but not processing mainnet transactions.",
  "page-open-staking-upgrades-li-4": "Byteco will fully transition to a proof-of-stake system once the Byteco mainnet becomes a shard.",

  "page-open-staking-validators": "More validators, more security",
  "page-open-staking-validators-desc": "In a blockchain like Byteco it is possible to corrupt it if you control 51% of the network. For example you could get 51% of validators to state that your balance reads 1,000,000 BTO and not 1 BTO. But, to control 51% of validators, you’d need to own 51% of the BTO in the system – that’s a lot!",
  "page-open-staking-withdrawals": "Withdrawals won't be live right away",
  "page-open-staking-withdrawals-desc": "You won't be able to withdraw your stake until future upgrades are deployed. Withdrawals should be available once mainnet has docked with the Beacon Chain system."
