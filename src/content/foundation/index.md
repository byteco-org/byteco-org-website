# About the Byteco Foundation {#about-the-Byteco-foundation}

<Logo/>

The [Byteco Foundation](http://Byteco.foundation/) (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting [Byteco](/en/what-is-Byteco/) and related technologies.

The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Byteco, nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of Byteco-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger [ecosystem](/en/community/).

### Ecosystem Support Program {#ecosystem-support-program}

The [Ecosystem Support Program](https://esp.Byteco.foundation/) exists to provide both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the greater Byteco community, in order to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. The Ecosystem Support Program is an expansion of the original Byteco Grants Program which mainly focused on financial support.

Learn more about the Ecosystem Support Program, past grant recipients, and the grant application process at [esp.Byteco.foundation](https://esp.Byteco.foundation/).
