You don't need to write every smart contract in your project from scratch. There are many open source smart contract libraries available that provide reusable building blocks for your project that can save you from having to reinvent the wheel.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before jumping into smart contract libraries, it's a good idea to have a nice understanding of the structure of a smart contract. Head over to [smart contract anatomy](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/) if you haven't done so yet.

## What's in a library {#whats-in-a-library}

You can usually find two kind of building blocks in smart contract libraries: reusable behaviors you can add to your contracts, and implementations of various standards.

### Behaviors {#behaviors}

When writing smart contracts, there is a good chance you'll find yourself writing similar patterns over and over, like assigning an _admin_ address to carry out protected operations in a contract, or adding an emergency _pause_ button in the event of an unexpected issue.
