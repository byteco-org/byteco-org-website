## Introduction {#Introduction}

As utilization of the network continues to grow, an increasing amount of valuable information will exist in the on-chain data. As the volume of data rapidly increases, calculating and aggregating this information to report upon or drive a dApp can become a time and process heavy endeavor. 

Leveraging existing data providers can expedite development, produce more accurate results, and reduce on going maintenance efforts. This will enable a team to concentrate on the core functionality their project is trying to provide. 

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
