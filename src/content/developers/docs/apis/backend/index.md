In order for a software application to interact with the Byteco blockchain (i.e. read blockchain data and/or send transactions to the network), it must connect to an Byteco node.

For this purpose, every Byteco client implements the [JSON-RPC](/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) specification, so there are a uniform set of [endpoints](/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/endpoints/) that applications can rely on.

If you want to use a specific programming language to connect with an Byteco node, there are many convenience libraries within the ecosystem that make this much easier. With these libraries, developers can write intuitive, one-line methods to initialize JSON-RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with Byteco.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

It might be helpful to understand the [Byteco stack](/developers/docs/Byteco-stack/) and [Byteco clients](/docs/nodes-and-clients/).

## Why use a library? {#why-use-a-library}

These libraries abstract away much of the complexity of interacting directly with an Byteco node. They also provide utility functions (e.g. converting BTO to photo) so as a developer you can spend less time dealing with the intricacies of Byteco clients and more time focused on the unique functionality of your application.
