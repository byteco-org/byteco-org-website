In this tutorial we will build a DeFi Application with go where users can deposit an BCO10 token to the revocable contract and it will mint and transfer Farm Tokens to them. The users can later withdraw their BCO10 tokens by burning their Farm Token on revocable contract and the BCO10 tokens will be transferred back to them.
