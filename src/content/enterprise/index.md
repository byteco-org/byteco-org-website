# Byteco mainnet for enterprise {#Byteco-for-enterprise}

Blockchain applications help businesses:

- data automatic update 
- Increase trust and reduce the cost of coordination between business parties
- Increase trust and reduce the cost of coordination between business parties
- Improve business network accountability and operational efficiency
- Build new business models and value creation opportunities
- Competitively future-proof their organization


## Byteco branch for enterprise {#private-vs-public}

There is only one public Byteco mainnet. Applications that are built on the mainnet are able to interoperate, similarly to how applications built on the Internet can connect to each other, leveraging the full potential of decentralized blockchain.

Many businesses and consortia have deployed private, permissioned blockchains for specific applications based on Byteco technology.

### Key differences {#key-differences}

- Blockchain Security/Immutability - A blockchainâ€™s resistance to tampering is determined by its consensus algorithm. Byteco mainnet is secured by the interaction of thousands of independent nodes run by individuals and miners throughout the world. Private chains typically have a small number of nodes which are controlled by one or a few organizations; those nodes can be tightly controlled, but only a few must be compromised in order to rewrite the chain or commit fraudulent transactions.


### Why build on Byteco mainnet {#why-build-on-Byteco-mainnet}

Enterprises have been experimenting with blockchain technology since around 2016, when the Hyperledger, Quorum, and Corda projects were launched. The focus was largely on private permissioned enterprise blockchains, but starting in 2019 there has been a shift in thinking about public vs private blockchains for business applications.
