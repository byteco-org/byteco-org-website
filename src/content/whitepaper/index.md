# Byteco Whitepaper {#Byteco-whitepaper}

_This introductory paper was originally published in 2020 by James Maskin, the founder of [Byteco](/what-is-Byteco/)._


## A new generation of free intelligent application platform based on industrial collaboration {#A new generation of free intelligent application platform based on industrial collaboration}

### Abstract {#Abstract}

- Byteco aims to build a model based on industrial collaboration and integrated artificial intelligence to control risk, interaction, automation and other functions. The design of a special economic model that many more users, the closer the single request fee is to free of interoperability blockchain internet. Due to industrial production collaboration, the landing applications such as decentralized finance, games, media, social networking, NFT, complex international commerce, industrial collaboration and remote office require up to ten thousand TPS. Byteco innovatively uses the Mongolian consensus and creates a revocable smart contract suitable for complex business scenarios. This blockchain uses dual-chain operation to demonstrate cross-chain collaboration, and dual-currency governance is used to ensure safety and reduce the operating costs of consumer. Flexible block time design and time sequence extension design are used to ensure safety and reduce costs. Optional privacy design can meet different application scenarios. 


## Social Collaboration {#Social Collaboration}

Since the birth of humans, weak humans have relied on the use of tools and cooperative hunting to defeat large predators whose size, weight, and strength are far greater than humans, and thus grow to be masters of the earth. Families, companies, other organizations, countries, etc. are all collective organizations based on social division of labor and cooperation. In other words, individual human beings cannot survive independently in the world. From the slavery society to the feudal society to the current industrialized society, the division of labor in human society has become more and more specialized. Specialized division of labor brings increased productivity while also increasing communication costs. According to the microeconomic model, the smaller the unit output, the higher the communication cost. 

As a new generation of computer fusion technology, blockchain technology has made outstanding contributions in a few areas such as transfer payments due to the reduction of trust costs. However, only by applying blockchain technology to industrial collaboration can the application be implemented in a true sense. Only blockchain technology that moves toward industrial collaboration can greatly reduce communication costs and bring a real leap in productivity.

The new crown pneumonia pandemic also shows that people must work together to overcome the common difficulties of mankind and improve the level of human civilization. The mission of the new generation of interoperability network advocated by Byteco is to promote human collaboration and increase productivity.

## The design of Byteco will follow the following principles： {#The design of Byteco will follow the following principles:}

### 1. The principles of openness, freedom and equality {#1. The principles of openness, freedom and equality}

- Byteco, as the next-generation interoperability network (it can be called the interoperability network), requires the design of each module to comply with the principles of openness, freedom and equality. This has to comply with these three principles to show the advantages of the next-generation interoperability network to attract users of the existing Internet that is suffering from a spiral collapse of monopoly, supervision and inefficiency.

- Maximum decentralization is the guarantee of openness. At present, Bitcoin and Monero on the Internet have done more thoroughly in terms of centralization. Byteco has further strengthened the decentralized design, including community building, token distribution, and based on the two decentralized experiences of Bitcoin and Monero. Miner participation, intranet module design, economic momentum design, etc.

### 2. Modular Design {# 2. Modular Design}

- Compared with ordinary smart contracts, the amount of data in revocable contracts is much larger. The data processing tasks involved in artificial intelligence are even dozens of orders of magnitude, and different computing modules call different models. The modular design is convenient for developers to call and debug each other, and the standard of modular Rubik's Cube can reduce the difficulty of development and speed up development. Modular composable features can be used by ordinary programmers to solve practical problems using artificial intelligence and revocable contracts.

### 3. Simplify {# 3. Simplify}

- This will ultimately help reduce the impact of any special individual or group on the agreement and promote the application prospects of this chain as an agreement open to everyone. Simplified standards will be easily invoked by programmers with little of experience.

### 4. Practical {# 4. Practical}

- From recruitment to design, the Byteco team pays attention to the participation of people with existing computer expertise and dual experience in other production and practice fields. The knowledge structure is not limited to sociology, law, computer, physics, mathematics, finance and other disciplines. Whether from model design to specific module matching, we pay attention to the real needs of blockchain applications.

### 5. Improving productivity and landing applications are the core principles {# 5. Improving productivity and landing applications are the core principles}

- To promote the integration and interaction of blockchain technology and other existing advanced technologies in other fields, to improve productivity and implement applications as the core criteria.

## Structure {# Structure}

The design of this chain is concise, and the first layer is composed of  network module,  data module, Mongolia consensus module, and revocable contract module. The second layer is composed of artificial intelligence module,  API module,  external consensus module and cross-chain bridge module. As shown below:

## Currency Issuance and Operation {# Currency Issuance and Operation}

### Dual Currency Design {# Dual Currency Design}

This chain uses a dual currency design. Block generation rewards use chain governance coins, the total amount is limited, and deflationary issuance. When staking mining, the staking currency adopts the governance currency. Here are some units set in advance for some amounts:

1: photon
$ 10^{6} $ :   neutrinos
$ 10^{12} $ :  preon
$ 10^{15} $ :  quark
$ 10^{18} $ :  byte (BTO)

### Stablecoin {# Stablecoin}

Traders' transaction fees are settled in stable currency, and the principle of minimum is implemented. Since there is no competitive bidding rule, traders only need to pay the minimum maintenance network operation consumption required stable currency fees, and wait for packaging according to the timestamp order.

At the present stage, the world economy has not produced major innovative theories and practices to break the polarization between the rich and the poor caused by the current capital drive. The stable currency (fiat currency) endorsed by government credit has to assume too many functions of the currency itself, such as additional issuance to alleviate the liquidity crisis, and economic growth will lead to over-issuance of broad currency. In this way, deflation and inflation all require excess currency to quench their thirst.

Therefore, a decentralized stable currency is an indispensable rigid demand in international settlements. According to Daines’s economic model, in the next 30 years, pure currencies without liquidity crises and crises of trust will gradually replace the Sovereign currency which be existing contradictory intertwined with infinite additional issuance and multiple functions.

The stablecoin designed by Byteco is also an important part of the network governance fee model.

### Reward System {# Reward System}

The block reward is divided into two parts, one part is a single block block reward, and the other part is the miner's packaging fee.

#### Block Reward {# Block Reward}

- The number of block rewards per block is fixed for a certain period of time. Every 4 years or when the number of coins reaches a certain amount, the reward halving measure is activated, and the halving is successively reduced in algebraic steps.

#### Transaction Fee Reward {# Transaction Fee Reward}

- This chain uses non-equal direct addition of miners' labor costs, but increases non-equal linearly according to the mathematical model. Because the computer is a great tool invented and mastered by mankind. On the premise of not increasing labor cost, there is a big difference between computing 1 data task and 2 data tasks, but computing 500 data tasks and 600 data tasks has very little difference in energy consumption and hardware consumption. According to the bee colony model(PSO) of artificial intelligence, the optimal solution of the unbalanced game can be obtained in the 5-party model with decreasing parameters of power, laber cost, hardware cost, computing tasks and transaction costs.

#### Free for Users Model {# Free for Users Model}

- Existing blockchain consumption models such as the first-generation technology of Bitcoin and the second-generation technology represented by Byteco have high transfer fees and outrageous calculation fees. They are essentially designed to exploit the application value too much, allowing a large number of participants to get less rewards, while the creators and mining work get more rewards for the upstream group than they paid.

- According to Byteco's model of non-equal addition of transaction fee rewards with packaging tasks, when the number of users is large enough, the transaction fee can be very much reduced to below 0.00001USD, and mature applications will then use fee transfer to subsidize consumers. , It can be completely free on the Byteco chain.


## Staking Mining {#Staking mining}

The staking adopts on-chain governance currency pledge, and the reward mechanism adopts the principle of dual-currency separate reward. Governance tokens produce stable output in accordance with each block, while stablecoin output is unstable and varies flexibly according to the packaging tasks.

## Flexible Block {#Flexible Block}

In order to improve the data processing capacity of this chain and reduce the consumption of security resources. This chain creates a flexible block time design, and the time for each new block to be generated is between 0.1 second and 1 hour. When there is little data processing, the speed of packing blocks can be reduced to one block per hour. When a lot of data needs to be processed, the mining block time can be increased to 0.1 seconds to generate a block.

The flexible block generation design is an environmentally friendly mining design. At the same time, it is not only environmentally friendly to block storage, but also environmentally friendly to earth resources. For miners, the get paid for work is fixed, and the miner's income model is more stable. At the same time, the security probability of the block can be greatly improved. When data processing tasks are accumulated, it can be quickly packaged, so as to avoid congestion caused by too many packaging tasks on the chain in the past block chain, so as to amicably adapt to the requirements of blockchain industrialization.

In the time of slow block generation, due to the significant reduction in the number of packaging tasks, the attacker's economic benefits are also relatively small, and network security will not be affected. There is a very low probability that huge transfers occur when there are few packaging tasks. At this time, the artificial intelligence module comes in handy. It can monitor the emergence of huge financial amounts and quickly invoke the rapid block generation mechanism.

## Time Extension Design {#Time Extension Design}

According to the theory of space physics such as string theory, human beings are in three-dimensional space, and everything that the human eye sees is three-dimensional, while the time axis is one-way prolonged and cannot be retreated or undone. It can help humans to calculate the motion of three-dimensional things. Track, promote the progress of human civilization.

At this stage, after the blockchain enters the 2.0 stage represented by Byteco, all block packaging designs follow the principle of two-way competition between Bitcoin miners and consumers. Then it means that a party with a strong economic power can gain the time advantage by paying more miners' fees (in fact, it is an economic bribery).

This design itself violates the principles of physics and the principle of sociological fairness. It is contrary to the open (completely decentralized), fair, free, and economic interconnection network advocated by this article. This design can promote miners to get more rewards, and promote the enthusiasm of miners to ensure network security. It has its enthusiasm, but the shortcomings are also obvious. When the number of users is large, the cost will soar and the network delay will be greatly. This design is unlikely to make blockchain applications truly landed. Even if the current single transfer of Byteco is reduced by 100 times, as the number of users increases by 100 times, the single transfer fee will soon return to more than 100 US dollars. Although Byteco has talented computer experts and designers, its lack of industrial practical experience has resulted in its design that violates economic laws. If the original cost model is modified, it will inevitably lead to a split in the community.

The design of this chain follows the time extension principle, and users are not encouraged to push up the network usage fee. All users wait in line for packing according to the timestamp after the lowest bid, and miners cannot choose the packing order, but can only pack according to the task order.

## Mongolia Consensus {#Mongolia Consensus}

The current blockchains on the market all adopt Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus or a consensus method that is slightly improved on the basis of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus. They all have a common feature, safety, high fault tolerance, but low efficiency.

The most powerful army in the Cold Weapon times is undoubtedly the Mongolian army, with power almost all over the Eurasian continent. Relying on three secret weapons, they swept across Asia and Europe in just a few decades, and they were invincible. These three secret weapons are tightly organized, advanced bows and arrows, and Asian horses with excellent endurance. The first of the rigorous offensive organizations is the pre-war consensus meeting model developed by Genges Khan and his counselors, which we call the Mongolian consensus. Advanced Mongolian bows and arrows can easily penetrate shields, and Asian horses with excellent endurance can provide good conditions for creativity in long-distance attacks. Among them, the Mongolian Consensus has played a decisive role. It is a model of rapid human cooperation.

The Mongolian Consensus is an efficient and secure consensus agreement. The security, speed, and scalability mentioned in the blockchain ceiling theory cannot be complete. The Mongolian Consensus achieves model optimization in these three aspects to promote the application of industrial blockchain technology.


- **High TPS** - The Mongolian Random Consensus can elevate the optical fiber network to the limit, around 70,000 TPS. A single chain can carry more than 50% of the current blockchain landing applications such as decentralized finance, gaming, social networking, nft, and industrial collaboration. Of course, its greatest value lies in the application of real industrial collaboration.

  
- **Probability of Safety** - The Mongolian random consensus is a consensus mechanism with high security and low fault tolerance.

- According to the random equation, the probability of a single attack at two points is 1/16, plus the penalty mechanism of pos mining. If an extremely wealthy miner has multiple trusted nodes in the past, the cost of his second attack behavior has risen exponentially, and many pretend attacks have also lost his pledged assets and become a lost opportunity to attack. In this way, 234 trusted nodes can basically guarantee Byteco's network security. And Byteco almost uses one hundred thousand or even more than one million nodes.
  
## Revocable Contract {#Revocable Contract}

From the sociological point of view, all kinds of social relations in human life are contracts (also called agreement), and conventions commonly known as ethics and laws are used to restrain people from complying with contracts to ensure the benign operation of social order. Due to time differences, regional differences, differences in human living habits, language barriers, communication effectiveness, cross-organizational coordination barriers, the degree of game between the two parties, earthquakes, fires, floods and other force majeure and other complex social relations constraints. The scope of use of contracts is less than 1% of social scenarios, while revocable contracts are applicable to about 80% of social scenarios due to their flexibility, while the remaining 19% of social scenarios are non-contractual relationships.

Since the birth of Bitcoin as the pioneering technology of blockchain technology, the second generation of blockchain represented by Byteco has realized the integration of contract technology. This chain is dedicated to the implementation and integration of revocable contract technology. As the name implies, a revocable contract is a contract that can be changed, renewed, and destroyed. If you cannot understand the concept of revocable contracts, then the existing blockchain crowdfunding and flash loans are the primary manifestations of revocable contracts.

Specifically in the field of decentralized finance, most hacker attacks at this stage can be avoided, and at the same time, it does not rely on the behavior of centralized administrators. Revocable contracts used in upgradeable contracts will become very friendly for developers.

Only flexible and changeable contracts can be adapted to very complex industrial application scenarios.  In reality, contracts are almost revocable. People with legal affairs experience and business experience, know that almost all the contracts encountered in the work are revocable contracts. The scope of irrevocable contracts is very limited.

  

- **Example 1:** - When an American retailer A tells his partner wholesaler B that my lawn mower is sold out, wholesaler B tells the Chinese factory C that we are out of stock, and places a new order for you (cancelable contract D) .

- Factory C tells his 13 spare parts supplier E (here are multiple E) and auxiliary material supplier I. Parts supplier E tells material supplier F to purchase new material F3, and tells abrasive tool manufacturer G how to make new ones Abrasive tool G3, abrasive tool manufacturer G needs to purchase their accessories and materials (H).

- Both wholesaler B and factory C need to contact logistics company J to arrange shipping. At the same time, it is necessary to declare exports and imports to the local government (L1 and L2).

- Different countries’ policies require the government or industry organization to issue a commodity quality inspection procedure K, and a third-party company to inspect the goods M. In the process of short-distance transportation, truck transportation company N needs to be introduced (N1 and N2 are required for both export and import).
All the design, production, raw materials, transportation, and trade links involved in hundreds of companies need to open their own bank accounts (bank S1, S2, S3, etc.).

- And insurance Y needs to be purchased during all kinds of transportation.

- When part of the contract was fulfilled, the lawn mower design company W told wholesaler B that the market for old lawn mowers had shrunk, and the government’s environmental protection policy changed and it needed to use more environmentally friendly materials, and the newly designed ones could make more money. Before it can be approved for import.

- Wholesaler B informs factory C of the original order change. After negotiation, B compensates C for a small amount of cost and re-executes the modified contract. Then C informs all companies involved in the division of labor to cancel the original contract and perform the new one. contract.

- It seems that international trade is complicated, but the actual international trade is much more complicated than described above. As long as any participant's own conditions or environmental conditions change, the partially fulfilled contract needs to be changed to adapt to industrial cooperation.

  
- **Example 2:** - For example, developer A develops an option smart contract B and deploys it on the blockchain. Hacker C found a code loophole and stole user D's money. The traditional smart contract (actually not smart at all, it's just what the inventor said) when it encounters a hacker attack, it is a white hat attack to invalidate the past contract, and there is no good way. The revocable contract can solve this problem well. While limiting the power of the administrator, the risk management module can prevent similar hacker attacks. If you encounter the problem of coordinated attacks on several contracts, if several of the contracts are revocable contracts, you can successfully resist similar risks.

## Artificial Intelligence {#Artificial Intelligence}

Artificial intelligence is a new computer technology that studies and develops theories, methods, techniques and application systems used to simulate, extend and expand human intelligence. Currently in machine vision, fingerprint recognition, face recognition, retina recognition, iris recognition, palmprint recognition, expert system, automatic planning, intelligent search, theorem proof, game, automatic programming, intelligent control, robotics, language and image understanding , Genetic programming and other fields are practical applications. The combination of revocable contracts and artificial intelligence can solve the automation of complex fields and can greatly increase productivity.

The Stanford artificial intelligence team gathered by Byteco will greatly simplify the design concept and further deep integration of revocable contracts. Programmers without a knowledge base of artificial intelligence can easily call various stable artificial intelligence modules to design highly intelligent Landing application.

This chain is designed for the security of the block network and only adopts a limited iterative artificial intelligence model based on stable mathematical model control. At the same time, some projects need to use the black box model and infinite iteration model to provide API. At the same time, for the sake of security on the chain, the artificial intelligence module and API module are placed in a two-tier structure, and access to the consensus module is prohibited.

## Application {#Application}

Generally, a variety of interoperable network landing applications can be run on the Byteco network.

- **Decentralized Finance** - The application of artificial intelligence module in Byteco, specifically in decentralized finance, can easily realize functions such as unattended, security, and gaming. When revocable contracts are used in decentralized applications with artificial intelligence, a large-scale optimization and replacement of the existing financial system can be realized. It is a great promotion in terms of safety, consumer experience, and capital circulation efficiency. The low cost of the Byteco network can greatly promote the application of high-frequency financial projects.

- **NFT（Non-Fungible Token）:** - NFT is a record based on the blockchain, which uniquely represents the fragments of the media. The media can be any number, including art, video, music, gif, games, text, memos, and codes. Due to its independence, computers are required to provide heavy calculations, and various models of artificial intelligence can be widely qualified for this type of boring and repetitive work with special requirements.

- NFT as a differentiated confirmation means that it is not suitable for batch operations in many scenarios, and the application of revocable contracts is very suitable for the unique contract requirements of a single NFT.

- The Byteco network's close to free cost consumption is very suitable for NFT, other long-tailed varieties projects and higher marginal costs projects.

- **Open Industrial Collaboration** - At this stage, a simple industrial collaboration involves hundreds of companies at every turn, from global R&D, design, production, transportation and other processes, to thousands of departments in the design department, involving tens of thousands of work types and staff. The cross-chain consensus in the Mongolian Consensus can resolve a large part of the collaboration with the entire application of revocable contracts and artificial intelligence, but under the current technical conditions, it can greatly reduce the cost of communication & friction, and reduce the consumption of inventory, energy, manpower, etc. in each processes. It will bring greater economic benefits, and can greatly increase productivity, greatly reduce the cost of customized products, and bring new economic growth points.

- Coordination within each industry chain and the inner of industry chain is the fundamental starting point of Byteco's design.

- **Open Agriculture, Logistics, Service Industry, General Insurance, Construction Industry, Human Resources, Government Affairs** - Byteco's safe and free design can greatly reduce the agricultural production and circulation supply links and the circulation threshold on the bulk commodity chain. The popular application of revocable contracts can solve various complex and changeable situations in actual production and circulation.

- Artificial intelligence and revocable contracts have real pain points in the intelligentization, automation and disintermediation of the service industry.

- The application of artificial intelligence in the judicial field makes general insurance more efficient and further disintermediation.

- Byteco has a broad application foundation for commodity resource allocation, human resource allocation and quality tracking in the construction industry.

- The main pain points of commodity circulation are cost, efficiency and transparency. With the help of Byteco's pragmatic and non-skilled design, it will greatly promote the logistics industry.

- The decentralized service industry will eventually be born first on the Byteco network.

- With the help of Byteco, open government affairs can be realized, which can not only improve efficiency, but also increase government credibility and curb corruption.

- Byteco can expand the current application of blockchain to more than ten thousand times the application space, not only limited to the application of the second-generation blockchain technology represented by Byteco to the decentralized finance and NFT industry.


- **Decentralized Social** - Artificial intelligence is widely used in social applications, relational models, intelligent search, etc. will increase the potential of decentralized social applications, and privacy applications will better eliminate people's concerns about decentralized social interaction. Social networking consists of weak relationships most of the time, and the willingness to pay is low. If the cost on the chain is too high, it will be disastrous for the development of relationships. At the same time, revocable contracts are widely used in social relationships, and strict contracts are too rigid and not suitable for social relationships. Fair and free social relations are also extremely lacking in the existing social system. The use of artificial intelligence, revocable contracts and free interaction fees can maximize the realization of social relationships in an equal, free, open, and efficient next-generation intercommunication network, and further improve social productivity and information transmission capabilities.

- **DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organization）** - The decentralized autonomous organization will be the main organizational form of the next-generation interoperability network. Its existence itself is of great significance to the interoperability network of freedom, democracy, and equality. Mankind started from the primitive society with equal cooperation and initial civilization. At this time, democracy has emerged. Everyone recommends powerful and intelligent individuals to lead the group against the invasion of other animals.

- At this stage, human beings have entered the age of industrialization for nearly 200 years, and the wisdom and response speed of individuals and individual groups cannot meet the needs of large-scale and professional social production and management. The rise of the DAO can efficiently realize the optimal distribution of wealth and resources in terms of fair decision-making.

- The free, fair, and efficient chain interoperability network design advocated by Byteco will bring more radical development to the DAO.

- **Decentralized Game** - Byteco's low cost, high TPS, revocable contract, and fair design can realize the utopian governance of the game in the virtual world, and consumers can get higher spiritual satisfaction in the virtual world. Efficient interoperability functions are more friendly to game developers.

- **Open Telecommuting** - With the help of modern computer communication technology in the optimal allocation of time and space, remote office human resources can achieve cost reduction and efficiency enhancement of human resources with the help of quantitative job allocation methods, which has a positive meaning for transportation, housing, and productivity. Byteco is a firm supporter of remote office, and the design of revocable contracts and cross-chain consensus will positively promote remote collaboration.

- **Decentralized Sharing Economy** -  The core of the sharing economy is the secondary deployment of resources in time and space. Byteco is designed for collaboration, and the innovation of thousands of modules ensures that the sharing economy can run on this chain.

- **Open Technology Research and Development** - The essence of the science and technology R&D industry is to mobilize social resources, including market and non-market factors such as technology, manpower, capital, materials, manufacturing, etc., with high costs and large uncertainties in returns. Byteco is close to free coordinated design, revocable contracts and privacy applications can greatly reduce R&D costs, especially long-tail R&D projects that do not match market capacity and R&D investment, and are more friendly to human society.

- **Decentralized Law Services** - Although the legal system is mature at this stage, the judicial cost is too high and the judicial efficiency is too low, wasting a lot of tax and litigation participants' time. Revocable contract applications can apply to wills, contracts, notarization, marriage, economy, labor and other aspects. The use of artificial intelligence can improve its efficiency.

- Byteco advocates a free, equal, and open interconnection network, and hopes that Internet laws will promote productivity while taking into account time and space fairness as much as possible. The wrong legal idea that the code is the law should be corrected, and the explicit and public code is just a formatted contract. We hope that more people will participate in the design, operation and governance in order to adapt to the network requirements of the new era.

## Optional Privacy Design {#Optional Privacy Design}

Privacy has rigid demands in various fields such as social networking, finance, trade, and industrial production, and it is necessary for the main chain to integrate privacy functions. Because privacy consumes a lot of computing data, the main chain does not turn on the privacy function by default. The user can open and call the privacy module.
Privacy is in rigid demand in financial, social, trade and other fields. Only when privacy is guaranteed can participants completely relieve their burdens and truly embrace blockchain applications.

## Interoperability Network (may be referred to as Intercommunication network) {#Interoperability Network (may be referred to as Intercommunication network, or intercomweb)}

The Internet, which was born in the 1970s, realized the interconnection and information display of various computers. Mobile Internet is to realize simple human-computer interaction. The author believes that the next generation of interconnection networks should be interoperable. Based on the revocable contracts and artificial intelligence on the blockchain, data interoperability, operation interoperability, intelligent interaction, and intelligent function call between chains and between applications and applications are realized. It can be called an intercommunication network, or intercomweb for short. The idea of the specific interconnection network can be described in detail in my other papers.

## Cross-chain Design {#Cross-chain Design}

The new generation of interoperability networks requires all chains to be interconnected. Not only can cross-chain transfers, cross-chain information exchange, and even groundbreaking designs can reach cross-chain consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.

Cross-chain is an important part of malleable design. Same as the main network, the cross-chain network module, data module, and consensus module are all integrated in the cross-chain bridge module. For security reasons, a forwarding filter module is reserved in the cross-chain bridge to ensure that the sender is harmless to the receiver. Although this will reduce cross-chain performance, but it is necessary.

## Branch Chain design {#Branch Chain design}

In view of the Mongolia consensus can solve the cross-chain consensus problem. Byteco designed a mainnet and a branch Chain. Official demonstration operation and maintenance. The main functions implemented by the branch chain network are decentralized storage, reading, and downloading functions.

At present, a square nanometer material storage medium has appeared in the laboratory. In the next few years, the storage cost of smart terminal equipment has room for a significant drop, and laboratory materials are still far away from the Planck scale limit. Therefore, the time when mobile phone storage space is surplus is getting closer. The mining design using the surplus space of the mobile phone itself can prevent card pool attacks, disperse the mining crowd to a greater extent, and achieve better decentralization effects.

## Storage {#Storage}

The minimum storage space requirement is 8G. The smart terminals participating in mining are not limited to all smart terminals such as cloud servers, mobile phones, smart TV, personal computers, and notebooks.

## Internet Speed {#Internet Speed}

Optical fiber networks and cloud storage devices represented by cloud servers are all optical fiber networks, which have higher network speeds and higher costs. Compared with terrestrial fiber optic networks, 5G networks have lower time delays. The network verification module sorts the corresponding speeds of the machine network of all miners and gives different storage tasks at the same time.

## Storage Market {#Storage Market}

The storage market module will rewrite the storage protocol in order to adapt to various storage devices.

## Search the market {#Search the market}

The search market will be based on the model to build a model that is extremely user-friendly and close to free. At the same time, miners will also get more work. According to the 5-factor bee colony optimization model of broadband cost, machine cost, electricity cost, labor cost, and consumer expenditure, an optimal solution to the unbalanced game is made. Due to machine costs, labor costs, and electricity costs are basically spent in the storage market, and broadband costs are also nearly half of the storage market, making consumer retrieval and download costs likely to be close to the goal of free. Its model is the same as the mining model of the main chain. As the number of users increases, it is moving towards the goal of free for consumers. In turn, it can promote industrialization and wide application.

## Chain Building Tool {#Chain Building Tool}

Developers will provide a set of chain building tools, which is different from the existing parachain paid auction system. Through this set of tools, anyone can build side chains for free and form a new side chain group through cross-chain consensus. They can replace all the functions of the existing alliance chain and have more functions of the main chain in the past blockchain 2.0 stage. Best important it is free.

After the main chain and side chain are launched, the development team will make a demo of international trade and financial cross-chain consensus to reduce the understanding of cross-domain collaboration among non-industrial program developers and promote the rapid application of blockchain technology to the broad development . The industries and fields involved in international trade itself are extremely complex, far more complex than social, gaming, cultural, financial and other fields.

## Development Language {#Development Language}

The development team is currently selecting a suitable language for the development of revocable contracts. If funds are abundant, a revocable contract for the development of a low-level security-triggered language will be recreated.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}

We have propose a new generation of blockchain system based on industrial collaboration, free for users, and capable of realizing landing applications. The Mongolian consensus double random inspection mechanism can take into account high-speed blockchain production and security requirements, and the revocable contract can adapt to the complexity requirements of landing applications. The open and free economic momentum model of design has changed the bottleneck of the current blockchain technology, and achieved a marginal effect in the blockchain network world for the first time. The original intention of being friendly to developers and users will bring geometric growth to decentralized applications.
