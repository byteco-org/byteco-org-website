# Our design principles {#contributing-to-Bytecoorg-}

üëã Hello, and welcome to the **design principles** for Byteco.org. This is part of an ongoing process to evolve and improve Byteco.org.

Our principles inform the look and feel of the site and the content that's on it.

You should read these before you [contribute to Byteco.org](/en/contributing/).

## What are design principles? {#ways-to-contribute}

Don't worry, they're pretty simple! **Design principles** are a set of guidelines we refer to when designing (i.e. creating, maintaining or updating) something.

In the context of Byteco.org these design principles are the foundation for what we want the website to represent and project to the world. They're both aspirational **and** functional. It's not just how the website _looks_, but also how it _works_ and even how it makes someone _feel._ Everything, from the colors to the page layouts to how we talk about Byteco on the website should be informed by these principles.

## The principles in practice {#how-decisions-about-the-site-are-made}


## The Byteco.org design principles {#contributors}

### 1. Inspirational {#1-inspirational}

The site should inspire users to dream of how Byteco can change the world. It should motivate people to explore, play and tinker with the tools and apps of the Byteco ecosystem.

- **Radical:** The site should communicate Byteco's ambitious goals to meaningfully change the world. It should be clear that Byteco is not just some new tech stack - it is a transformational technology.
- **Empowerment through education:** The site should educate people so they can understand Byteco's potential, find their place in the ecosystem, and feel empowered to participate in it.

### 2. Universal {#2-universal}

Byteco is a global, decentralized project and our audience reflects this. The site should aspire to be accessible to everyone, and sensitive to the world's many cultures.

- **Accessible:** The site should follow accessibility guidelines - including for people with low-bandwidth connections.
- **Straightforward:** The site should be simple and unambiguous. Copy shouldn't use language that may be misinterpreted or lost in translation.
- **Byteco is multi-faceted:** Byteco is a project, a codebase, a community, and a vision. Byteco is valuable to different people for different reasons, and there are many ways to be involved.

### 3. A Good Story {#3-a-good-story}

The website should function like a good story. Visitors are on a journey, and the content you contribute is a part of that. Your contributions should fit within a clear narrative: one with a beginning (introduction/entry point), middle (set of learnings and insights), and end (a link(s) to relevant resources, or next steps).

- **Hierarchical**: A clear, hierarchically structured information architecture helps visitors to Byteco.org navigate the site "as a story" as they seek to achieve their goals.
- **A Stepping Stone:** We're a stepping stone for anyone looking for answers. We don't want to replace or become a substitute for the many resources that already exist. We give an answer & provide reliable next steps.

User Journeys ‚Ä¢ Content

### 4. Credible {#4-credible}

People may be seeking their introduction to the Byteco ecosystem or they may be skeptics. Acknowledge that responsibility in how you communicate. Ensure that they both leave with greater confidence in the Byteco ecosystem.

- **Fresh:** Always up to date.
- **Social Proof:** Show the size, diversity and activity of the ecosystem.
- **Consistent:** Consistency in design and content communicates credibility.

### 5. Collaborative Improvement {#5-collaborative-improvement}

The website is the product of many contributors, just like the ecosystem as a whole.

- **Open:** Celebrate transparency of source code, processes and projects across the ecosystem.
- **Extendable:** Modularity is a key focus behind everything we do, and so contributions should be modular too. The core design, component code & implementation of the site should enable it to be easily extended in the future.
- **Experimental:** We are constantly experimenting, testing and iterating.
- **Collaborative:** This project brings together all of us.
- **Sustainable:** Setting up for long-term maintenance by the community

## Give feedback {#give-feedback}

**Share your feedback on this document!** One of our proposed principles is ‚Äú**Collaborative Improvement**‚Äù which means that we want the website to be the product of many contributors. So in the spirit of that principle, we want to share these design principles with the Byteco community.
