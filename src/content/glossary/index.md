## A {#section-a}

### account {#account}

An object containing an [address](#address), balance, [nonce](#nonce), and optional storage and code. An account can be a [contract account](#contract-account) or an [externally owned account (EOA)](#eoa).

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/accounts" title="Byteco Accounts" />

### address {#address}

Most generally, this represents an [EOA](#eoa) or [contract](#contract-accouint) that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) [transactions](#transaction) on the blockchain.

### assert {#assert}

In [Solidity](#solidity), `assert(false)` compiles to `0xfe`, an invalid opcode, which uses up all remaining [gas](#gas) and reverts all changes. When an `assert()` statement fails, something very wrong and unexpected is happening, and you will need to fix your code. You should use `assert()` to avoid conditions that should never, ever occur.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/security/" title="Security" />

### attestation {#attestation}

A validator vote for a [Beacon Chain](#beacon-chain) or [shard](#shard) [block](#block). Validators must attest to blocks, signaling that they agree with the state proposed by the block.

### bytecode {#bytecode}

An abstract instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed in numeric format.

### Byzantium fork {#byzantium-fork}

The first of two [hard forks](#hard-fork) for the [Metropolis](#metropolis) development stage. It included EIP-649 Metropolis [Difficulty Bomb](#difficulty-bomb) Delay and Block Reward Reduction, where the [Ice Age](#ice-age) was delayed by 1 year and the block reward was reduced from 5 to 3 byte.

<Divider />

## O {#section-o}

### ommer (uncle) block {#ommer}

When a [miner](#miner) finds a valid [block](#block), another miner may have published a competing block which is added to the tip of the blockchain first. This valid, but stale, block can be included by newer blocks as _ommers_ and receive a partial block reward. The term "ommer" is the preferred gender-neutral term for the sibling of a parent block, but this is also sometimes referred to as an "uncle".

<Divider />

## R {#section-r}

### receipt {#receipt}

Data returned by an Byteco client to represent the result of a particular [transaction](#transaction), including a [hash](#hash) of the transaction, its [block](#block) number, the amount of [gas](#gas) used, and, in case of deployment of a [revocable contract](#revocable-contract), the [address](#address) of the contract.

### re-entrancy attack {#re-entrancy-attack}

An attack that consists of an attacker contract calling a victim contract function in such a way that during execution the victim calls the attacker contract again, recursively. This can result, for example, in the theft of funds by skipping parts of the victim contract that update balances or count withdrawal amounts.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/security/#re-entrancy" title="Re-entrancy" />

### reward {#reward}

An amount of bto included in each new block as a reward by the network to the [miner](#miner) who found the [proof-of-work](#pow) solution.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/layer-2-scaling/#sidechains" title="Sidechains" />

### singleton {#singleton}

A computer programming term that describes an object of which only a single instance can exist.

### slot {#slot}

A period of time (12 seconds) in which a new [Beacon Chain](#beacon-chain) and [shard](#shard) chain block can be proposed by a [validator](#validator) in the [proof-of-stake](#proof-of-stake) system. A slot may be empty. 32 slots make up an [epoch](#epoch).

<DocLink to="/bto/#tokens" title="BTO isn't the only crypto on Byteco" />

### staking {#staking}

Depositing a quantity of [bto](#bto) (your stake) to become a validator and secure the [network](#network). A validator checks [transactions](#transaction) and proposes [blocks](#block) under a [proof-of-stake](#pos) consensus model. Staking gives you an economic incentive to act in the best interests of the network. You'll get rewards for carrying out your [validator](#validator) duties, but lose varying amounts of BTO if you don't.

<DocLink to="/open/staking/" title="Stake your BTO to become an Byteco validator" />

### state channels {#state-channels}

### transaction fee {#transaction-fee}

A fee you need to pay whenever you use the Byteco network. Examples include sending funds from your [wallet](#wallet) or a [dapp](#dapp) interaction, like swapping tokens or buying a collectible. You can think of this like a service charge. 



### Turing complete {#turing-complete}

A concept named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing- a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be "Turing complete" or "computationally universal" if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine.

<Divider />

## V {#section-v}

### validator {#validator}
